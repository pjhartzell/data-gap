**Notebooks:**

- `missing_sliver.ipynb` contains an example of the data gap produced by `odc-stac-load`
when loading and reprojecting adjacent MODIS sinusoidal tiles to UTM.
- `anchor.ipynb` illustrates that anchor values appear to be ignored in the latest
version of `odc-stac` 0.3.9.

The `requirements.txt` file contains the pinned dependencies for a project that I'm
working with.
